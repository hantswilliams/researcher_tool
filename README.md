# Researcher Tool (MVP)
- Need to insert description here 

## Structure

## Notes to self: 
- Create python scripts for pulling data down from pubmed (API) -> see python_scripts folder 
- Likely have the python_script sitting on a lambda endpoint hosted within AWS 
- Create a graphQL / (hasura?) endpoint for easy integration with a react frontend
